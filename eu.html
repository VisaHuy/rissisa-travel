                <h2 class="intro__title">What didn't we see there?</h2>
                <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36%
                    planning to spend their holidays in their home country. Like, what have we not seen here at home? In
                    fact, Russia
                    - this is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the
                    harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. AND
                    you can still see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many hours of
                    flights.
                    Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother, who took three children in her arms, sat
                    them down
                    in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers in her native country. We have selected and described
                    some
                    interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                            First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes
                            strewn with pine trees,
                            mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted
                            with the invisible
                            by the miracle of these places - mountain air.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in
                            summer. So
                            you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, over
                            the ridges
                            eagles fly, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of

                            most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for
                            competitions
                            skiing. This is a sport where the skier ties himself
                            to the motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice.

                            year at the festival "Baikal Mile" a world record was set - 197.011 km / h.</p>
